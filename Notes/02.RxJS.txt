1. Reactive Extension API
2. RxJS - Provide single API (Observables - To deal with stream of data)
3. Stream of data can be?
4. Observables, Observers, Subject (Which emmits the value - Subject maintains the list of observers to get notified) 
  eg. Subject(Youtube) -> Observer(Subscriber) -> Subject emmits the data to all the observers -> Observer notified -> Then executes their own logic
  Single subject broadcast the value to multiple observers.
5. RxJS Observer Pattern - Softare development pattern with Observables
6. In RxJS -> Subject called as Observables
7. Observables (Subject) -> Has subscribe() method -> Observer used this menthod to registered
8. Observer having object with next(), error() and complete() method

9. How to create custom observables from scratch?
10. Different ways of creating observer
11. How to cancel the subscribe() method? - unscribe() method


/* OPERATORS */
1. from - used to transform the iterable data to an observables
2. fromEvent - used to convert event into an observables
